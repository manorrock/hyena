# OmniFaces Oyena CDI

The OmniFaces Oyena CDI module delivers you CDI-based implementations that can
be used to extend the behavior of Eclipse Mojarra or Apache MyFaces.

## Prerequisites

Your project should already be configured to use Eclipse Mojarra or Apache
MyFaces.

## Configuration

To use it in your web application you will need to add the following Maven
dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.omnifaces.oyena</groupId>
      <artifactId>oyena-cdi</artifactId>
      <version>x.y.z</version>
    </dependency>

Where you need to replace x.y.z with the version you want to use.
